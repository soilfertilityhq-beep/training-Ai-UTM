# 🌿 Plant Nutrient Deficiency Detection

This project explores how to identify and understand **nutrient deficiency symptoms in plants** using both **quantitative** and **qualitative** methods. It is designed to be educational and accessible to all levels — from students to researchers.

---

## 📌 Purpose

Plants show visible signs when they lack essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and others. Detecting these symptoms early can improve crop health and yield.

This project:

- Explains the symptoms associated with major nutrient deficiencies.
- Uses **quantitative analysis** (e.g., leaf measurements, chlorophyll levels).
- Uses **qualitative analysis** (e.g., visual inspection, symptom descriptions).
- Includes code, data, and documentation for reproducibility and learning.

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- 🌱 Students learning plant science or agriculture
- 🧑‍🔬 Researchers analyzing crop health
- 🧑‍💻 Developers working on agri-tech tools
- 🌾 Farmers looking to understand symptoms practically

## 🧰 Features

- 📊 Quantitative methods (e.g., numeric thresholds, image metrics)
- 👁️ Qualitative methods (e.g., color change, leaf shape, visual cues)
- 🧪 Dataset of healthy and nutrient-deficient plant images
- 🛠️ Tools for analyzing and classifying symptoms
- 🤖 Optional: Integrations for machine learning model training (e.g., for leaf classification)
